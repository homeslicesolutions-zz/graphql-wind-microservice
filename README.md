# graphql-wind-microservice
Experimental project to use GraphQL with Node/Express with our Rome API

To test it, ```yarn``` then do ```yarn start```

The configuration like port name and namespace, look at ```configuration.json```

After running, try to hit this API: ```http://localhost:3001/graphql```


## Key things:
- It's all about the structure of the files and where they are location and how it's built
- It's supposed to be scalable and easy to stick in Middleware as needed.  Also easier to add new routes to do other things outside of API.  The main thing is the API structure
